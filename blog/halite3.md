## Halite-III: Two Sigma's AI Challenge

[TwoSigma](https://www.twosigma.com/) has been running a programming based AI challenge since 2016 which I've found to be helpful to work towards my goal of learning AI techniques and applying them. While I do not have any good documentation around my ventures into Halite- I & II, this year I'm planning on documenting all of my steps here.  
  
Please note that this is coming from someone who is beginner in the field and has at best rudimentary knowledge in the field of AI.  
  
Here are all the resources I'd need to get started on the challenge:

Deadline: January 22, 2019  

While this is a competition, my sole intention to participate is to make the most optimized bot I can while learning some AI fundamentals and applying them in the process. So, I have no concern over having this information publicly available during the game phase unless it contradicts the rules set by TwoSigma for participants.  

Let's take quick dive into making a basic bot which will help to understand the problem at hand.
