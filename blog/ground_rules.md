## Setting Some Ground Rules for the Blog  

Instead of having a perfect set of rules for a "perfect" blog, the sole rule is to put any idea / project in reasonably easily understandable writing.  
So you may see some draft documents lying around for projects that I've started but are on hold or stuck in limbo (hopefully not for perpetuity).  

Also, there is a possibility that these rule(s) change/evolve as more content gets added here. But for starters, there are no loafty goals for the blog.
